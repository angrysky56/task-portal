## Documentation Standards

### Core Documentation
- Must include logical proofs where applicable
- Must specify ethical constraints
- Must detail verification requirements
- Must include integration points

### Reference Documentation
- Complete API documentation
- Implementation details
- Usage guidelines
- Integration requirements

### Example Documentation
- Working code examples
- Step-by-step guides
- Use case demonstrations
- Integration patterns

## Validation Requirements

### Logical Validation
- All logical reasoning must be formally verified
- Failed logic is never acceptable
- Clear distinction between logical and non-logical domains
- Rigorous verification for non-logical approaches

### Ethical Constraints
- Must maintain ethical bounds
- Must implement virtue metrics
- Must verify ethical compliance
- Must document ethical considerations

### Integration Requirements
- Clear component interfaces
- Verified interactions
- Documented dependencies
- Tested integration points

## Documentation Updates

The documentation structure should be maintained with:
1. Regular updates for evolving components
2. Version control for all changes
3. Clear change tracking
4. Maintained logical validity
5. Preserved ethical bounds

For questions or updates, refer to the individual component documentation in the appropriate directories.
